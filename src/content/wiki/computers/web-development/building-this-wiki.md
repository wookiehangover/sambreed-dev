Two things were on my mind:
1. I don't ever seem to have the patience or wherewithal to write an entire blog post.
2. I have been getting a lot of use, joy, and mileage out of my personal notebook.

Knowledge graphs and text processing have been frequent themes in my work over the last few years. I have wanted to build a hypertext for a long time. I built my first website around 1996 on Geocities and I have been trying to make [places made of language](../places-made-of-language) ever since. I blogged for about 6 months in 2008 and 2009.

I was inspired by:
* Maggie Appleton's digital Garden
* Blogs, in the old school
	* Dave Rupert
	* Chris Coyier

Astro 2.0 added some interesting content management features.
