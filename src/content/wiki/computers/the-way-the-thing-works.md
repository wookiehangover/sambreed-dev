> Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like. People think it's this veneer â€” that the designers are handed this box and told, 'Make it look good!' That's not what we think design is. It's not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.

I'm writing this down because I need to remember it. Design is not how something looks or the colors or the typography. It is the entirety of the product, the materials it's made of, the experience of using it in total.
