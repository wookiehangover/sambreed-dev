Welcome to my person wiki. This is a place where I've started to gather notes, lists, and other writing in way that's less time-sensitive than blogging but more sharable and permanent than my [personal notebook](./computers/notetaking).

In the spirit of digital gardens, these are web pages that act as the potential seeds for ideas. Some of it mundane, some of it informational, but at least it's written down.

_Key_:
| Icon | Type | Description |
|-|-|-|
| <svg viewBox="0 0 20 20" width="20" height="20"><use href="/icon-sprite.svg#icon-note"></svg> | Notes | Everything starts as a note. |
| <svg viewBox="0 0 20 20" width="20" height="20"><use href="/icon-sprite.svg#icon-list"></svg> | Lists | I also make a lot of lists. |
| <svg viewBox="0 0 20 20" width="20" height="20"><use href="/icon-sprite.svg#icon-book"></svg> | Books | Intention to expand this with a bit more metadata |
| <svg viewBox="0 0 20 20" width="20" height="20"><use href="/icon-sprite.svg#icon-link"></svg> | Links | Sometimes you just need a link. |
