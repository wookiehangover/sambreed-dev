## Kits

[Satisfy](https://satisfyrunning.com/) - I was a sucker for instagram ads and bought what seemed like a too-expensive t-shirt from them. Then I got hooked. Their cotton hits a combination of soft-light-durable that's very impressive. For a while after college I worked in the backstock of an American Apparel where I dealt with unholy volumes of cotton t-shirts, so I consider myself [somewhat of an expert].

[Tracksmith](https://www.tracksmith.com/) - Everything I have from Tracksmith is fantastic.

[Ciele Athletics](https://cieleathletics.com/) - As best I can tell, Ciele makes hats that are indestructible. I have only purchased more than one hat from them to try different styles. The original hat I bought 4 years ago still looks bright and unworn, and I've run hundreds and hundreds of miles in it, and running it through a washing machine cycle every time. They are unkillable.

## Shoes

_Active_

- New Balance [Fresh Foam 1080v12](https://www.newbalance.com/pd/fresh-foam-x-1080v12/M1080V12-MPS.html) - This is my main shoe. I vow to put at least 500 miles on every pair before retirement.
- New Balance SuperComp Trainer - This is my _other_ main shoe. It's speedier and springy-er than the 1080.
- Hoka One One Speed Goat - This is my go-to trail running shoe. I'm on my 4th pair already. I dabbled around with other wide-sized trail shoes but this is the one that's given me the most comfortable miles.

_Retired_

- SuperComp Elite - I really wanted to try a super shoe, but they don't come in wide sizes. I took a gamble and lost. I could go fast in them but the upper was just too uncomfortable, so I didn't do the marathon in them.
-  GS Tam - I really wanted to like these, but they weren't wide enough for me in my size. Another sad shoe-gamble!

## Tech

Apple Ultra Watch. Over time I'm less convinced that this is a "great" option for running. But I don't have a basis for comparison so it is my winner by default.

[Powerbeats Pro](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MY582LL/A/powerbeats-pro-totally-wireless-earbuds-black). More battery life than I have endurance. Sweatproof. Physical buttons, no touching or tapping.

- Strava
- Training Peaks
- [Watchletic](https://www.watchletic.com/) lets me use custom run plans from Training Peaks but still record using Apple HealthKit

## Misc

Bandanas. Cheap, versatile. They keep you warm in the wind. Get it wet and it cools you down in the sun. Can never go wrong with a classic cotton bandana.

Salomon Adv Skin 12 backpack. I had the medium version for several years and then realized it was a bit too small for me. I have the large version now in red. Holds stuff. Lots of straps and options for water.
