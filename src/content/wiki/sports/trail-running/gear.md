# Gear

## Kits

Satisfy - 

[Tracksmith](https://www.tracksmith.com/) - Everything I have from Tracksmith is fantastic.

Ciele

## Shoes

### New Balance

_Active_

[Fresh Foam 1080v12](https://www.newbalance.com/pd/fresh-foam-x-1080v12/M1080V12-MPS.html) - This is my main shoe. I vow to put at least 500 miles on every pair before retirement.

SuperComp Trainer - This is my _other_ main shoe. It's speedier and springy-er than the 1080.

_Retired_

SuperComp Elite - I really wanted to try a super shoe, but they don't come in wide sizes. I took a gamble and lost. I could go fast in them but the upper was just too uncomfortable, so I didn't do the marathon in them.

### Hoka One One

Speed Goat - This is my go-to trail running shoe. I'm on my 4th pair already. I dabbled around with other wide-sized trail shoes but this is the one that's given me the most comfortable miles.

### GS Tam

I really wanted to like these, but they weren't wide enough for me in my size. Another sad shoe-gamble!

## Etc

Bandanas. Cheap, versatile. They keep you warm in the wind. Get it wet and it cools you down in the sun. Can never go wrong with a classic cotton bandana.

Salomon Adv Skin 12 backpack. I had the medium version for several years and then realized it was a bit too small for me. I have the large version now in red. Holds stuff. Lots of straps and options for water.

Apple Ultra Watch. Over time I'm less convinced that this is a "great" option for running. But I don't have a basis for comparison so it is my winner by default.
