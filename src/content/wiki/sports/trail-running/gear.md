## Kits

[Satisfy](https://satisfyrunning.com/) - I was a sucker for instagram ads and bought what seemed like a too-expensive t-shirt from them. Then I got hooked. Their cotton hits a combination of soft-light-durable that's very impressive. For a while after college I worked in the backstock of an American Apparel where I dealt with unholy volumes of cotton t-shirts, so I consider myself [somewhat of an expert].

[Tracksmith](https://www.tracksmith.com/) - Everything I have from Tracksmith is fantastic.

[Ciele Athletics](https://cieleathletics.com/) - As best I can tell, Ciele makes hats that are indestructible. I have only purchased more than one hat from them to try different styles. The original hat I bought 4 years ago still looks bright and unworn, and I've run hundreds and hundreds of miles in it, and running it through a washing machine cycle every time. They are unkillable.

## Shoes

_Active_

- New Balance Fresh Foam 1080v13 - This is my main shoe. I vow to put at least 500 miles on every pair before retirement.
- New Balance SuperComp Trainer - This is my _other_ main shoe. It's speedier and springy-er than the 1080 and features a carbon plate. Most importantly, this is a supershoe that comes in wide sizes. My next marathon will be in a pair of these.
- Hoka One One Speed Goat - This is my go-to trail running shoe. I'm on my 4th pair already. I dabbled around with other wide-sized trail shoes but this is the one that's given me the most comfortable miles.

_Retired_

- SuperComp Elite - I really wanted to try a super shoe, but they don't come in wide sizes. I took a gamble and lost. I could go fast in them but the upper was just too uncomfortable, so I didn't do the marathon in them.
-  GS Tam - I really wanted to like these, but they weren't wide enough for me in my size. Another sad shoe-gamble!

## Tech

_Active_

- Garmin Eduro 2. I finally switched to a real runner's watch, and I was right in my assumption that I didn't know what I was missing. Apple Watch looks like it has all the right features but it misses on a couple of key points: variety of workout interfaces and interactions, navigation, distance/elevation accuracy, and battery life.
- [Powerbeats Pro](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MY582LL/A/powerbeats-pro-totally-wireless-earbuds-black). More battery life than I have endurance. Sweatproof. Physical buttons, no touching or tapping.
- Strava

_Retired_

- Apple Ultra Watch. Over time I'm less and less convinced that this is a "great" option for running. But I don't have a basis for comparison, so it is my winner by default.
- Training Peaks. I consulted with them back in the early 2010s. The software is ok, but over time the design wore me down. Strava has less data but is more pleasing to look at.
- [Watchletic](https://www.watchletic.com/) lets me use custom run plans from Training Peaks but still record using Apple HealthKit

## Misc

Bandanas. Cheap, versatile. It keeps you warm in the wind. Get it wet and it cools you down in the sun. Can never go wrong with a classic cotton bandana.

Salomon Adv Skin 12 backpack. I had the medium version for several years and then realized it was a bit too small for me. I have the large version now in red. Holds stuff. Lots of straps and options for water: 2L reservoir and 2x 1L flasks.

Recovery kit: Normatec therabody recovery legs, Hoka One One recovery sandals, lacrosse ball, anti-fatigue mat + [standing desk](/wiki/computers/what-i-use#desk), theracane, Yeti 32oz Rambler
