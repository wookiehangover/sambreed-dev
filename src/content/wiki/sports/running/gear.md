## Kits

[Satisfy](https://satisfyrunning.com/) - I was a sucker for instagram ads and bought what seemed like a too-expensive t-shirt from them. Then I got hooked. Their cotton hits a combination of soft-light-durable that's very impressive. For a while after college I worked in the backstock of an American Apparel where I dealt with unholy volumes of cotton t-shirts, so I consider myself [somewhat of an expert].

[Tracksmith](https://www.tracksmith.com/) - I have been buying their shorts for several product cycles now and they're reliable up to a point. One pair of thicker half tights (circa 2021-2022), good California-winter option but are lacking in pockets; another thinner pair of half tights have decent pockets but chafe on long runs or consecutive days of wear; and then their 4" mesh shorts, which I've gone through several pairs of when the seam at bottom of the liner eventually gives out, but keep on buying because they're a good summer option.

[Ciele Athletics](https://cieleathletics.com/) - As best I can tell, Ciele makes hats that are indestructible. I have only purchased more than one hat from them to try different styles. The original hat I bought 4 years ago still looks bright and unworn, and I've run hundreds and hundreds of miles in it, and running it through a washing machine cycle every time. They are unkillable.

## Shoes

The problem with running shoes is that if you run a lot, you end up collecting lots of shoes. My options are limited to wide sizes, or otherwise I am cursed with self-inflicted pain.

I used to list active and retired sections, but It would fill spreadsheet by now if I listed it all out. My thinking has evolved to approach shoes by category, with defaults and exceptions as needed.

**Daily driver.** New Balance 1080 has been the most reliable daily shoe for me. Each revision tends to be minor. I tend to go through 3 pairs on each version, finding that they stay comfortable to around 400 miles, after which switching to a new pair offers a noticeable improvement.

**Option.** Some days it's nice to switch to a different shoe. This is where I might try a different brand, or go to other New Balance models like the SuperComp Trainer or FuelCell Rebel.

**Trail running.** I had been on a good kick with Hoka Speed Goats but then stopped buying them for a release cycle. My v4's kept on blowing out the sidewall before the sole went, and the sole width seemed a bit more narrow than previous versions. The reviews online for the v5 kept me from buying them. I plan to order the v6 and see how it goes. I have a pair of New Balance Hierro but they don't feel robust enough for a big session.

**Race day**. For marathons or other road races I now have the option for the high end New Balance race shoe, the SuperComp Elite, which now comes in wide sizes.

## Tech

_Active_

- Garmin Eduro 2. I finally switched to a real runner's watch, and I was right in my assumption that I didn't know what I was missing. Apple Watch looks like it has all the right features but it misses on a couple of key points: variety of workout interfaces and interactions, navigation, distance/elevation accuracy, and battery life.
- [Powerbeats Pro](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MY582LL/A/powerbeats-pro-totally-wireless-earbuds-black). More battery life than I have endurance. Sweatproof. Physical buttons, no touching or tapping.
- Strava

_Retired_

- Apple Ultra Watch. Over time I'm less and less convinced that this is a "great" option for running. But I don't have a basis for comparison, so it is my winner by default.
- Training Peaks. I consulted with them back in the early 2010s. The software is ok, but over time the design wore me down. Strava has less data but is more pleasing to look at.
- [Watchletic](https://www.watchletic.com/) lets me use custom run plans from Training Peaks but still record using Apple HealthKit

## Misc

Bandanas are cheap, versatile, and easy to carry around. A good bandana keeps you warm in the wind; get it wet and it cools you down in the sun. Can never go wrong with a classic cotton bandana.

Salomon Adv Skin 12 backpack. I had the medium version for several years and then realized it was a bit too small for me. I have the large version now in red. Holds stuff. Lots of straps and options for water: 2L reservoir and 2x 1L flasks.

Recovery kit: Normatec therabody recovery legs, Hoka recovery sandals, lacrosse ball, anti-fatigue mat + [standing desk](/wiki/computers/what-i-use#desk), theracane, Yeti 32oz Rambler

[Stuart and Lau Regiment Gym Bag](https://stuartandlau.com/products/the-regimen-gym-bag). I found this using [Bench](https://bench.io) in one of our earliest demos agentic search -> browse -> summarize loops. The high level query was "find me a gym bag" and with a little refinement over price range, size, and other requirements I was lead to this brand. After a year, the bag has zero signs for wear despite almost daily use.
