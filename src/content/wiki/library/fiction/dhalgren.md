I read [The New Yorker profile on Delany](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/07/10/samuel-r-delany-profile) and immediately bought _Dhalgren_, as it sounded like it was up my alley. I asked my brother if he had read it, which he said he had, several times, which triangulated the recommendation to me. This is a long book and doesn't have much in the way of exposition or trad narrative, so I suspect it will be on my backburner for a while.
