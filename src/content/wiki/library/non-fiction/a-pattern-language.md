p798, Chapter 171 _Tree Places_ on the significance of old trees in humanity: "Since... psychic growth cannot be brought about by a conscious effort of will power, but happens involuntarily and naturally, it is in dreams frequently symblized by the tree, whose slow, powerful involuntary growth fulfills a definite pattern." C.G. Jung, _Man and his symbols_
