For as long as I can remember, I had assumed Web Components (Custom Elements) were in the "still baking" phase of the standards lifecyle. Not yet ready for consumption unless you wanted a more hazardous life as a web developer.

That's no longer true: Web Components are ready to use.*

Dave Rupert recently [shared a post](https://daverupert.com/2023/10/fitvids-has-a-web-component-now/) about his `<fit-vids>` component that caught my attention. For the first time, Web Components seemed simple and approachable. I didn't have to re-write my entire website to use them! I decided to follow his example of giving Custom Elements a try the next time I need a little DOM thing.

As of today, I have three little components. Two are in active use and one is archived:

* `<share-button>` wraps a standard `<button>` to trigger the [Web Share API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Share_API) if available, otherwise copying the link to the clipboard.
* `<reply-link>` uses the Shadow DOM to keep my email address out of crawlers.
* `<code-block>` applys syntax highlighting to a child `<pre>` tag using the [Shiki library](https://shiki.matsu.io/). This is no longer used.

\*_More or less._ If you want a full framework, look at something like [Enhance](https://enhance.dev/). My examples are not by any means comprehensive.

## ShareButton

This is a case where I normally would have written a few lines of vanilla JS and called it a day. With Web Components I can write a few lines of vanilla JS and call it a day, but this time with newer tools.

The component launches a share sheet using the [Web Share API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Share_API) when available, otherwise it copies the current link to the clipboard (and changes the button text to indicate what just happened).

The user experience doesn't seem that much different. But after years of using UI components in other contexts, I prefer the custom element:

Custom Element:
```html
<share-button
    data-title="Little Web Components"
    data-link="/writing/2023/lil-web-components">
  <button>Share</button>
</share-button>
```

CSS Selector:
```html
<button class="share-button"
    data-title="Little Web Components"
    data-link="/writing/2023/lil-web-components">
  Share
</button>
```

I like the Custom Element because it clearly delineates between presentation and function. `<button>` is a visual element. `<share-button>` is a functional element.

<summary>Here's the source for <code>&lt;share-button></code>:</summary>

```ts
class ShareButton extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super();

    const { title, link, description } = this.dataset;
    if (!link) return;

    const $button = this.querySelector("button");
    if (!$button) return;

    $button.addEventListener("click", () => {
      if ("share" in navigator) {
        share()
      } else if ("clipboard" in navigator) {
        copyToClipboard()
      }
    });

    function share() {
      // call navigator.share()
    }

    function copyToClipboard() {
      // call navigator.clipboard.writeText()
      // swap the button text
    }
  }
}

customElements.define("share-button", ShareButton);
```

## ReplyLink

This one seems a little silly and is definitely an afterthought. Instead of dumping a plain old anchor tag with a `mailto:` URL scheme, I've wrapped that into a custom element. Similar to ShareButton, I pass in a `title` and `link` and the component formats the URL scheme to open an email with a subject and a body.

Before / without JavaScript, the link is inert. Maybe you're not a fan, but I'm fine with this. There's a little extra work to go through in order to get the link styled correctly, but that's the cost of [using the Shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_shadow_DOM).


```html
<reply-link
    data-title="Little Web Components"
    data-link="/writing/2023/lil-web-components">
  â†’ Reply
</reply-link>
```

You can see this and ShareButton in action at the bottom of this page.

```js
class ReplyLink extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }
  connectedCallback() {
    const { title, link } = this.dataset;
    if (!link) return;

    const shadow = this.attachShadow({ mode: "closed" });
    const subject = encodeURIComponent(`Re: ${title}`);
    const body = encodeURIComponent(`\n\nLink to: ${link}\n`)

    const style = document.createElement("style");
    style.textContent = `
      a {
        color: var(--text-dim);
        text-decoration: none;
      }
      a:hover {
        text-decoration: underline;
        text-underline-offset: 2px;
      }
    `;

    const a = document.createElement("a");
    a.setAttribute("href", `mailto:test@example.com?subject=${subject}&body=${body}`);
    a.innerHTML = "â†’ Reply";

    shadow.append(style, a)
  }
}

customElements.define("reply-link", ReplyLink);
```

## CodeBlock

Rest in peace, `<code-block>`, I've already stopped using you.

It is better to do this at build time rather than on the client. Astro v3 has built-in support for Shiki, making my code embed plugin cool but useless!

```js
class CodeEmbed extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super()

    const lang = this.getAttribute('lang') ?? 'javascript'

    formatCode(this.innerText, lang).then((html) => {
      this.innerHTML = html
    }).catch((err) => {
      console.error(err)
    })
  }
}

customElements.define('code-block', CodeEmbed)
```

I've left out the listing for `formatCode()`, but know that initializes Shiki with the correct language bundle and returns a string of highlighted HTML.

~If code block above has a dark background and syntax highlighting, then you know the Web Component is working ðŸ˜…~ Astro does this for me now!

Going forward I'll only use the `<code-block>` for situations where syntax highlighting needs to happen clientside, like when presenting repsonses from an LLM that contain code. That was the original use-case for this custom element, so back on the shelf it goes.

Or I might bring this back to inject a Copy to clipboard option. It was a feature of the Svelte version that I left out because I wanted to do Light DOM only.
