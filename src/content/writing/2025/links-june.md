I've been accumulating browser tabs again, and [Bench](https://bench.io/) makes it easy to turn my browser upside down and shake out all the good stuff I've looked at recently. AI is like a dirt bike for the mind.

## AI and code

* [Y Combinator is going all-in on AI agents, making up nearly 50% of latest batch](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/y-combinator-is-going-all-in-on-ai-agents-making-up-nearly-50-of-latest-batch) · 67 out of 144 startups are AI agent companies. That's... a lot.
  * I didn't actually read any of this, but rather spend ~$3 for Bench to do it all for me: [Y Combinator Spring 2025 Batch: Comprehensive Market Analysis](https://bench.io/artifact/5e8de496-2ae2-4784-a085-c6f4002eede8)
* [GitHub survey finds nearly all developers using AI coding tools](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3489925/github-survey-finds-nearly-all-developers-using-ai-coding-tools.html) · 97% of developers use AI tools but only 38% of US orgs encourage it. Classic corporate lag.
  * Again, this isn't really me browsing. This is an eval for Bench: [What Top Developers Want in 2025](https://bench.io/artifact/4367fca7-9c52-497d-9ba5-3a0b2f1cb750). Prompt here:
	```

* [My AI Skeptic Friends Are All Nuts](https://fly.io/blog/youre-all-nuts/) · Tired of AI skepticism, makes the case that modern agents can actually do useful things like interact with Git and run tools. The discourse is exhausting but this is a good counterpoint.
* [Andrej Karpathy on UIs and AI collaboration](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1930354382106964079) · Products with rich UIs but no scripting are "ngmi" in the AI era. dobe is probably sweating.
* [Sriram Krishnan's LLM wishlist](https://x.com/sriramk/status/1930153058924683280) · Wants personal data always in context and automatic task agentification. Same, honestly.
* [After court order, OpenAI is now preserving all ChatGPT user logs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44185913) · Court ordered them to keep all logs, including "deleted" chats. Turns out delete doesn't actually delete. Shocker.
* [unpdf: PDF extraction and rendering across all JavaScript runtimes](https://github.com/unjs/unpdf) · Works everywhere, optimized for serverless. I needed this for making Bench documents render markdown for SSR.

## Web rabbit holes

* [A History of DHTML and Web Applications](https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/postscript/web-apps-web-sites-are-they-all-the-same/) · Deep dive on BrainMatter, a 1999 web spreadsheet that only worked in IE. The more things change...
* [Ryan Florence on iframes](https://x.com/ryanflorence/status/1928560016073572668) · "This time I'd like you to read up on iframes." Cryptic but Ryan's usually onto something.
* [New wave of 'pog' mania crests over Hawaii (1993)](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-06-07-mn-611-story.html) · Kids in 1993 preferred cardboard milk caps over Nintendo because "everything is different every time." There's probably a lesson here about unpredictability vs. algorithmic content.
  * these were all part of generating [History of Pogs](https://bench.io/artifact/2052df34-ee80-4fa9-9458-3c122c4eb34d) with Bench.
* [Adam Nash's Apple transparency story](https://x.com/adamnash/status/1932224216960758070) · Teaser for a Steve Jobs story involving volleyball and transparency in 1997. Need the full story.

## Hot takes

* [Document databases as "sloppy software"](https://x.com/yacineMTB/status/1934383646854557760) · "Stinky software engineers pervert it with document DBs and other sloppy software." Harsh but not wrong.
  * [The quoted tweet is a cathedral](https://x.com/johnfreehayes/status/1934312768070639651)
* [I encourage all my competitors to take weekends off.](https://x.com/sambreed/status/1933674022853881986) More time for the rest of us to read links and build things.
