* [Writing CSS In 2023: Is It Any Different Than A Few Years Ago? — Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/07/writing-css-2023/) - There really has been a watershed moment in the past few years, and CSS features have been popping up left and right.

* [ffmprovisr](https://amiaopensource.github.io/ffmprovisr/) and [Activities and Exercises - ffmpeg-artschool](https://amiaopensource.github.io/ffmpeg-artschool/activities.html) - once upon a time I dreamed of doing things with film and video. In retrospect it was a brief couple of years, but one of the things that I did not learn in film school was how to manipulate _digital_ video outside of editing software. Luckily, I got to work on a project in the early days of [Quick Left](/cv.html#quick-left) that touched ffmpeg, and I've been a casual user of it ever since. Both of these links are interesting. The first is what you always want to have when using a dauntingly complex CLI like `ffmpeg`. The second link is mad science.

I didn't realize that came with a large selections of free magazines like The New Yorker. I was a subscriber for several years but the print issues pile up quickly. This is a profile of a new-to-me author, Samuel R. Delany. I picked up Dhalgren and am reading it now.
